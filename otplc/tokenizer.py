    For a given input `sentence`, list its tokens.

    This tokenizer extends the :func:`symbol_tokenizer` by splitting fewer cases:

    * Dots appearing after a letter are maintained in the word, except for the last word in a
      sentence if that dot is the sentence terminal. Therefore, abbreviation marks (words
      containing or ending in a ``.``, like "i.e.") remain intact and URL or ID segments remain
      complete ("www.ex-ample.com", "EC1.2.3.4.5", etc.). The only dots that never are attached
      are triple dots (``...``; ellipsis).
    * Commas surrounded by alphanumeric characters are maintained in the word, too, e.g. ``a,b``.
      Commas, semi-colons, and colons "dangling" at the end of a token are always spliced off.
    * Any two alphanumeric letters that are separated by a single hyphen are joined together;
      Those "inner" hyphens may optionally be followed by a linebreak surrounded by spaces;
      The spaces will be removed, however. For example, ``Hel- \\r\\n \t lo`` contains a (Windows)
      linebreak and will be returned as ``Hel-lo``.
    * Apostrophes are always allowed in words as long as they are not repeated; The single quote
      ASCII letter ``'`` is only allowed as a terminal apostrophe after the letter ``s``,
      otherwise it must be surrounded by letters. To support DNA and chemicals, a apostrophe
      (prime) may be located before the hyphen, as in the single token "5'-ACGT-3'" (if any
      non-ASCII hyphens are used instead of the shown single quote).
    * Superscript 1, 2, and 3, optionally prefixed with a superscript minus, are attached to a
      word if it is no longer than 3 letters (optionally 4 if the first letter is a power prefix
      in the range from yocto, y (10^-24) to yotta, Y (10^+24)).
